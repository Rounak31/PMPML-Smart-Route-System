Overview
Welcome to the PMPML Pune Smart Route System Machine Learning Project! This project is designed to improve and modernize the public transportation experience in Pune, India, by leveraging machine learning and RFID technology. It offers several key features to enhance the efficiency and convenience of the PMPML bus service.

Features
1. Nearest Bus Stop Detection
Our system uses machine learning algorithms to determine the nearest bus stop to a user's current location. This feature helps passengers easily locate the most convenient bus stop for their journey.

2. Cluster Analysis of Bus Stops
We employ clustering algorithms to group bus stops in close proximity to each other. This optimization enhances bus routes, reducing travel time for passengers and improving overall efficiency.

3. Ticketing System
The project includes a user-friendly ticketing system that allows passengers to purchase tickets using their smartphones or other devices. Machine learning may be used to detect and prevent fraudulent ticketing activities.

4. Bus Tracking with RFID
Each PMPML bus is equipped with RFID technology, enabling real-time tracking of bus locations. Passengers can track the exact position of their bus and plan their journeys accordingly.

5. Fare Calculation through RFID
RFID technology also facilitates automatic fare calculation based on the distance traveled by passengers. Machine learning models analyze RFID data to determine the fare, ensuring accuracy and transparency in pricing.
